This program produces a unique set of numbers in accordance with the MEGA MILLIONS lottery. Five numbers from 1 to 70 are selected and one number from 1 to 25. Although statistically innaccurate, this project makes the superstitious assumption that lightning never strikes the same place twice. More interestingly, this program utilizes data obtained from www.megamillions.com to ensure it produces a ticket that has not been drawn since February 2, 2010.
